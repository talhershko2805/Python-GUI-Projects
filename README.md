# Python GUI Projects

A collection of small GUI apps I build while learning Python + Tkinter.

## Projects

### 1) To-Do List App (Tkinter)
A simple task manager with:
- Add task
- Delete selected task
- Save tasks to a local file (`tasks.txt`)
- Load tasks from the file

Folder: `todo_app/`

## How to run a project
1. Make sure Python is installed (3.10+ recommended).
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python todo_app.py
